MACHINE PROBLEM 1

COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS

Simpliy enter 'make' into the command line and the makefile should automatically
compile the program for you.

RUNTIME INSTRUCTIONS

Enter './tree' into the command line in order to start the program. For this
problem, I was only tasked with adding the listPostOrder and the deletenode
features. Just follow the prompted instruction to operate the program.

For some delete examples...

k
 \
  m

Delete 'm' for leaf test or 'k' for one child on the right test.

  k
 /
j

Delete 'k' for one child on the left test.

  k
 / \
j   m

Delete 'k' for 2 child simple case. (m should replace)

  k
 / \
j   n
   / \
  m   o

Delete 'k' for 2 child with left child w/ 2 children. (m should replace)

  k
 / \
j   o
   / \
  m   p
   \
    n

Delete 'k' for 2 child with a long sub branch. (m should replace and n should
                                                be shifted to where n was)
